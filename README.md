This file contains all of the work I have completed for the sub-systems listed above for NUnite. 

The document titled 'KV6002 Team Project and Professionalism Assignment 2 Stakeholder Evaluation.docx' showcases the amount of work I have done on the application, along with the feedback I've obtained from stakeholders regarding the final version of the product. It also includes how I gathered data from stakeholders and why I gathered it.

The 'profanity.csv.' file contains a sample dataset that I used to train the machine learning model on Microsoft Azure. The dataset contains a sample size of 30 text posts that are labeled as inappropriate and appropriate.

My contribution to the Front-End Development will be found in the app folder itself. I contributed to the Report Page, the Post Options Page, the radio plugins and the function linking a Post to the Post Options Page.

My contribution to the Machine Learning can be accessed on Microsoft Azure Machine Learning. However, I cannot export it due to the complexity of Azure Machine Learning. I am available to demonstrate it in the Assignment 2 demo and my group members and supervisor can vouch for me working on my Machine Learning subsystem for several weeks.

If you plan on testing the Machine Learning model, you could even make your own by creating a Microsoft Azure account and accessing the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning page through the Microsoft Azure website. Following the tutorials there will lead you to model creation, where you can feed the model the 'profanity.csv' dataset and train it to recognize inappropriate content.
